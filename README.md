# Bluetooth-Receiver-Prototype-

Important: The diagram of the prototype can be found under the tab labelled "Wiki" within this repository

Notes:

-This code aims to test if the bluetooth receiver can recieve signal and then use the signals to execute a command 

-In this example the bluetooth receiver is only being used to control an LED whilst in the final product the bluetooth receiver shall send multiple commands
